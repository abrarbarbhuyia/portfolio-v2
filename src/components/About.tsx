          Ever since I was little, I was curious about the interaction between
          people and computers, and how everything we do on a computer is so
          intuitive and smooth to use. I enjoyed fiddling with different
          computer applications, and as a result, I was always using the
          computer that my parents had bought originally to do their work.

        <p className="text-black">
          I found out about programming through playing video games, and then
          came across videos explaining the world of coding. This idea of
          creating new things from scratch through just a computer piqued my
          interest and stayed with me throughout High School, so I decided to
          pursue Software Engineering in university.
