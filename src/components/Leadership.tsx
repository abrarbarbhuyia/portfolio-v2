          <p className="text-black">
            As a leader for a group assignment in Software Engineering Studio
            1A, I was always making sure that the team communicated effectively
            throughout the creation of a table booking app. This allowed us to
            meet deadlines throughout the semester, and finally allowed us to
            deliver a demonstration that was above and beyond the expectations
            of the tutor.

            As a general committee member in the UTS Programming Society, I

            have their interest in programming sparked.
